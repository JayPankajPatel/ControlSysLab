# ControlSysLab
## Simulation 1 
This simulation is an introduction to modeling control systems using matlab. In this simulation, a dc motor was modeled where we compared the open loop system of the model to the closed feedback loop of the model. In the closed feedback loop, it was assumed that the negative feedback loop is one, the controller is one, and there are no disturbances in the system. 
Here is the Simulink diagram of both the open and closed loop systems.

Here is the output of both of the models
